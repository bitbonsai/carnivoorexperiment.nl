# Meat, Salt, Water: My 2025 Carnivore Journey
Hey there! I'm Mauricio, I live in the Netherlands and I'm about to eat nothing but **meat** for a while. (Yes, really.)

This isn't my first rodeo with different diets â€“ I've been a vegetarian for 17 years, and done from [keto](https://medium.com/wolff-experiments/3-months-of-keto-9aaa37e5950c) to [extended fasting](https://medium.com/wolff-experiments/experiment-3-water-fasting-3843aa283dad), and I even tried the carnivore diet before. **But this time, I'm documenting every step of the journey**.

**Why?** Well, partly because Future Mauricio will definitely want to remember how this went. And maybe, just maybe, my experiences might help someone else who's curious about this whole meat-only lifestyle.

**Quick disclaimer:** I'm not a doctor, nutritionist, or any kind of health expert. I'm just someone who likes to experiment with different ways of eating and living. Think of this more as a friend sharing their diary rather than proper advice.
