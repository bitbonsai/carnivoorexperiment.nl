One week eating fruits. Not a beautiful bowl like above, just one pear, or half a small melon, or an apple.

What about the results? Well, two-fold.

1. I like fruits. I like sweets. Fruits after a month eating meat taste extremelly sweet, which is nice.
2. Maybe every night before going to bed was not such a good idea. And maybe the rigor of **every night a piece of fruit** is not the best way to go with it.

I woke up that week with a bit of gas, which wasn't the case before, and sleep wasn't particularly better than without. So I'd say it's going to be **sometimes a piece of fruit, whenever I want** instead of a routine. That shall work better.

Having that in mind, it's nice to spread a bit the possibilities. But I don't wanna go too far to be able to measure things.

So one of these days I went to the office, and there was nothing there suitable, apart from fruit. I didn't eat the fruit though, didn't feel like it.

### Strategy: if there's no food for you, fast!

I remember once I was reading a book by Swamy Vishny Devananda, and he was telling when he was sent to Canada by his Guru, Swamy Shivananda, to spread Yoga in the West. 

He didn't have money, so he'd do Yoga in a park or something, and since he didn't have money for food, he'd fast.

I found the idea fascinating, because it flips the mindset. If you can't eat what you should, you can start fasting! So it's not a constraint, it's a decision, a choice. 

Love it. **It's a life hack**. And it works. And since it's my decision, it's easy to fast for a few hours.
