Impressive. One month has passed. [I feel good](https://youtu.be/pTdihu-mp90?si=D5BmDWw-fbLc1JZQ).

So it's working. However, this is an experiment, and as such, it's time to introduce a variable and see how it affects the results.

### The variable: fruits

I'll eat a bit of watermelon today. Why? Because in the _autoimunne protocol_ from Dr Paul Mason, the diet that cut my cholesterol in half in a month, eating basically fatty meats, there were some concessions for some fruits. And for some reason, watermelon was on the list. And I ❤️ watermelon.

But I'll start slow. A bit today, see the effects, lower or increase the amount depending on results. Next one will be apples.

Then, after probably 2 weeks, I believe the next variable would be honey. If I can eat meat, fats, fruits and honey, I believe I don't need anything else.

### What about pizzas, ice cream... vegetables???

Yeah, nope. Maybe once a month, if the opportunity arises, I'd eat an ice cream. But really, if I have fat enough, I don't crave sweets.

The problem with pizza is the dough. Inevitably bloat afterwards.

### Vegetables, greens, fiber, we need those!

Really? There's [some](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136989/) [published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22555633/) [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25734566/) suggesting that fiber might not be needed or even harmful for some individuals.

For me, I was vegetarian for 17 years, so I might have eaten enough vegetables for this incarnation. The truth is I don't miss it, so for now, I'm good, thanks.

Well, let's see. in the next update I should have some results of these changes...
