The idea is simple. Eat only meat, water and salt, for a period of time, and observe the effects.

This is not the first time I do this. When I [removed my appendix](#addlink) in 2021, I was reading a book: [Carnivore Code](https://www.amazon.com/Carnivore-Code-Unlocking-Returning-Ancestral/dp/035846997X) by Paul Saladino (at that time he was only eating meat).

In the book there was a compelling argument for meat to reduce infection, and there I was, in a hospital bed, thinking how I could reduce infection after a surgery. It was a no-brainer for me to try it.

After the surgery I did a lot of exams, and found out my LDL was too high. The GP recommended taking statins, which I didn't want to. He recommended me to an specialist, that I found on the internet was the biggest name on statins. So I searched who was the best doctor in Australia that disliked statins, [Paul Mason MD](https://www.drpaulmason.com.au/). 

### The autoimune protocol

De Mason recommended a diet where there was one ingredient I could eat as many times and as much as I wanted: **meat**.

> So that's what I did. Fat rib eyes, sparkling water and salt. For 3 months

The results were amazing. I lost weight, my LDL dropped by half in one month, and I felt better than ever.

Then I started to introduce watermelon, that for some reason was on his protocol. Since watermelon is my favorite fruit, no problems whatsoever.

Then, life happened, and I started to eat more things. Fast forward to the end of 2024, and after moving continents, starting a new job at [Miro](https://miro.com/), and basically changing my whole life one more time, I found myself not feeling that great.

## The big reset. That's the idea

Let's eat only meat again

Then, I thought: what if I do it once again? I've done it once, and it worked. So I decided to start on Jan 1st and see what happens. No end date on sight, no goal, just do it and see what happens.

> Since the beginning of the year, I'm having only meat, salt and water. And I'll keep it that way until I feel better. One, two, three months? Who knows.

The difference is that this time I'm keeping a journal, this website. And when I start to introduce new things, will do it slowly and in a controlled manner.

**So, basically this is a website for myself**. But if you're interested, you're welcome to follow along. And [get in touch](/contact), if you want.

To 2025 and all its positive transformations!
