Something interesting happened... I ate noodles.

Normally that's not very interesting, but I think the whole story is. Let me explain...

I was in a social event, with a group of friends. Then someone suggest we go have dinner together. Awesome idea!

Immediatelly I suggest De Plantage or Canniballe Royalle, I know those places, they're nice and fancy and the food is good. And they have meat!

However, in one of them the reservation was too late and the other was a bit too meat centric, and we had vegan people in the group. Then someone suggested this place, Yellow River.

We went there, and being a chinese restaurant, I assumed there would be some meat option, but nope. Just soup/noddles.

I chose what apparently was the beef option with more beef in it, and waited.

It was a noodle soup with thin slices of beef, that I consumed in 5 minutes? Oh, important detail: we were in an event that didn't have any option for me, so I was fasting the whole day, starving at what was around 6:30 pm.

**Result**: after eating the beef and sipping through the soup, I was hungry. And **I ate the noodles**.

Low and behold, 30 minutes later, I had a brick in my stomach. Doing my best to disguise the discomfort, I went home to use the only thing I had in mind to solve it. **Apple Cider Vinager Tea**.

After drinking about half a liter, and waiting 30 minutes for it to settle, I started to feel better, and could sleep. But let me tell you, after one and a half months of only eating meat, it felt like a bomb. Some of it might be psychological, but in any case, I felt it.

### The next day
There was another event, and I gladly declined to eat. Fasting all the way, also to recover from the previous night.

**Does that mean I'll never eat noodles again?** Of course not! But not as a surprise. And would adapt with small portions.

And ramen, which is basically the same thing, according to Hui, but for some reason I find the japanese version more familiar.

Well, summary: if you're into a restrictive diet, it's better to fast than to eat a little and feel the hunger kick in.
