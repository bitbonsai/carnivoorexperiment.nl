**A short update. I'm still [alive and kicking](https://youtu.be/ljIQo1OHkTI?si=2-Y756lriUR6cq16)**

Just wanted to share my meal from yesterday. Yes, sometimes I have OMAD (one meal a day) not because I plan to do it, but because I'm so satiated there's no need to eat at night.

>  I had a fantastic meat-only feast that felt perfectly balanced and satisfying.

### What it consisted of:

- ~300g of Entrecote (steak)
- ~100g of Chicken Liver
- ~200g of Chicken hearts
- ~100g of Bacon
- ~100g of Fat (vetspek)
- Salt
- Lime (squeezed)

And that was it. Around 800g of diverse meats, and I was full.

This week there's a project going on at work, so I only had time to eat this and go to the gym for half an hour. I also had a Dutch class, but I asked to transfer it to the next week because my brain was fried.

### Another day, another mix

So, today (28) I ate for lunch lamb, stake and bacon. 

im liking this mixed protein stuff ðŸ¤£

### Next steps

Next week I'll be doing this for a month. I'm feeling good, lighter and more focused. So I'll keep going until I feel like ðŸ˜Š.
