Yesterday was pretty interesting!

We hosted a dinner with some friends at our place, and everyone was happy and having a great time.

The table was a feast of amazing dishes everyone brought along.

> So, what do you do when the table is filled with foods not on your experiment list?

Here's how I handled it:

First off, I didn't announce my specific diet. I wanted everyone to feel comfortable bringing whatever they liked.

When it was time to eat, I casually took out the air fryer and popped in some burgers I had in the fridge. I kept chatting and mingling, not making a fuss about my food choices.

I had to flip the burgers once, and someone eventually asked what I was up to. I simply said I was making burgers. Once they were ready (just 7 minutes with a single flip), I served them up and offered them around. One friend took me up on it, and everyone else was happy with the other dishes.

I polished off my four burgers and felt great. Success!

Here's my tip list if I find yourself in a similar situation again:

1. Keep it cool: Your food choices are yours alone.
2. Stealthly prep your meal: No need for a big announcement.
3. Share the love: Offer your dish around.
4. Enjoy your meal: Eat what's left with no worries.
5. Pro tip: If you're air frying burgers, flip them once for best results.

And that's it. Felt really good to have people around, everybody was happy, and I was able to keep my experiment without any major issues or having to talk too much about it.

## No updates then?

Oh well. Sleep is still messed up. Waking up at 3:30am. Now I'm using ocean waves sound to go back to sleep, which works faster for me.

Cravings are lower, today I put some spekblokjes in my rib eye. Tastier and more fullfilling :)

Oh, and I had a tea. And black coffee. Will change the index page to add those, I'm having those regularly, so it's not just meat, water and salt.
