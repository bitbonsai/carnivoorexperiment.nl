Today I'm completing 1 week of this experiment. What's going on, what are the perceived effects and what I'm expecting for the next one?

### First, some very subjective things:

- **Cravings down â†“**. I can look at any food and that doesn't mean anything.
- **Dreams up â†‘**. I'm dreaming more and remembering more the dreams. And no, it's not about food.
- **I'm feeling lighter**. I'm not measuring weight, but I feel lighter.
- **My hair is thicker**. And I think a bit blacker. I can't explain it. But I believe it is ðŸ˜„

### Now, some more objective things:

- **Bloat is gone**. I ate a lot during the holidays, and I'm ok with that. Happiness kilos, as some say.
- **My gumns stopped bleeding** when I brush my teeth. This started when I was in Brazil, I'm assuming too much sugar and other things.
- **Sleep is still messy**. I'm still waking up at around 3:30 am, and taking some time to go back to sleep.
- **Weights are heavier** at the gym. Physical activity in general is a bit harder. When I did keto 8 years ago, it took 1.5 weeks to adapt and start to burn fats and feel energy levels like before and more. I believe it's the same, so at some point next week it should normalize.
- **I'm more focused**. It's easy to get into focus mode and be productive in less time.
- **I'm feeling thirsty**. And I admit I'm not drinking enough water. Will work on that on the second week.

For now, that's it.
